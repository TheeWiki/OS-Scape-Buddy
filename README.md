# OS-Scape Buddy
This project of mine will be developed by myself. My goal for this project is to have a ultra light weight single application that can give the best experiences ingame, etc.. I'm always open to suggestions, changes, reports towards this project. I'd ask users to not claim their own copyrights for this application.

# Application Accessibility
This application is written in Visual Basic, which can be run on Windows OS. The application is single instanced which means users will not be able to open multiple application forms of OS-Scape Buddy.
